# BlogPostProject

This repository contains all files associated with the Data Science Blog Post Project for Udacity's Introduction to Data Science Course. 

## Installation
This project made use of the following libraries that can be downloaded via pip using Python versions 3.* 
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit learn
- seaborn
- os
- datetime
These can be downloaded using the requirements file.

## Motivation
This project used data from AirBnB listings in Seattle to answer questions frollowing the CRISP-DM process. Listing data was used to address the following questions that aid in deepening a business understanding of the Seattle AirBnB market.
- What style of accommodation allows for highest revenue?
- Can we predict price using categorical and quantitative values?
- What effect does distance from city center have on revenue?
The revenue variable is a calculated variable that factors in a listing's price and availability over the next 30 days to give a better sense of the property value in the eyes of a renter. While a listing may have a high price, if it never gets booked it is not a desirable option. 

## File Decriptions
The Project notebook file is a jupyter notebook that addresses the three questions with annotation. The requirements text file can be downloaded and used to install all additional libraries. The archive folder contains the kaggle dataset.

## Results
A summary of the results can be found in the medium blog post here*.
