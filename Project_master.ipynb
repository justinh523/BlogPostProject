    "# Analyzing Data from Airbnb's Seattle Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "An opportunity exists to analyze the vast amount of data collected by Airbnb and extract information that could help current and prospective landlords optimize their presence in the market. Data collected by Airbnb contains information from both the owners of listings as well as customers who have reviewed the properties, giving insight on both sides of the business. Given the dataset's breadth and depth of detail, multiple insights can be gained on the market. The focus of this notebook will be on determining how certain listing attributes affect the revenue of a property, as well as an investigation into whether or not a model can be trained to predict the price of a given listing. The three specific questions to be addressed are as follows:\n",
    "- What style of accommodation  allows for highest revenue?\n",
    "- What effect does distance from city center have on price?\n",
    "- Can we predict price using categorical and quantitative values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering the first two questions will lay the groundwork for other individual variable analyses. Once the code is in place to examine a variable's effect on revenue, any other independent variable can be analyzed in a similar way with minimal pre-processing. The prediction model will likely be more of a first step towards creating an accurate prediction. The scope of this project will not involve anything more than a built in scikit learn linear regression model. Given the complexity of the data and the mix of variables, it is possible the results from this model will not be sufficient for deployment in an actual business context, however it will be useful to demonstrate trends and illustrate whether or not a more complex algorithm might be able to better analyze the data."

Lofts and townhouses are other good options, while houses and apartments make up a massive portion of the market already, meaning there might be serious competition in that segment. A well planned treehouse or yurt clearly has the potential to generate even more revenue, however that segment is perhaps riskier given the lack of available data."

This leads to the conclusion that the linear regression model was picking up on a real trend, it just might not be the best algorithm to analyze this set of data."

    "This notebook examined methods to extract data from Airbnb's data on their Seattle marketplace. The data was examined and cleaned to allow for thorough analysis, with additional information such as revenue and distance from city center being extrapolated from the available variables. The questions that were specifically addressed were:\n",
    "- What style of accommodation  allows for highest revenue?\n",
    "    - It was determined that although treehouses generate the highest revenue on average, there are only three listings that fall into this category and further data would be needed to make an accurate judgment on that listing type. Out of the available data, it can be confidently stated that condominiums are the type of listing that generate the highest revenue.\n",
    "- What effect does distance from city center have on price?\n",
    "    - After extrapolating distance from city center using the latitude and longitude data, it was determined that listings closer to the downtown area generally generate a higher revenue, though there are also more properties in this area, leading to increased competition. Listings significantly outperform the average revenue all throughout the distances examined.\n",
    "- Can we predict price using categorical and quantitative values?\n",
    "    - Extracting a trend from the data for accurately predicting listing price is possible, although it was shown that a basic linear regression model does not do this to a sufficiently precise degree. The variables that had the highest impact on the price prediction were logical, and the possibilities for a tool that leverages the trends in the data are promising and would be very helpful for breaking into this market.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Further modelling with the cleaned data should be done, as well as any other analysis of the effect of independent variables on listing revenue. It would also be interesting to incorporate sentiment analysis of customer reviews into the price predictions for the listing as it could reveal more details about the listing that would be not available in data only provided by the property owner.\n",
